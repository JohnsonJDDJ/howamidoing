A place to keep track of your grades for all of your courses. `Howamidoing` handles all kinds of complicated grading policies and can calculate your current grade and estimate your class standing according to the policy.

**For example**: A common undergraduate level technical course can be graded on a _curved_ basis, with additional policies such as _assignment drops_, and _exam clobbers_. You can consult a comprehensive demo here (TODO: binder link).

## TODOs:

The project is still under progress. 

1. Python backend script for calculating score (Completed).
2. A simple web interface for one-time calculations
3. A fully interactive web app.
